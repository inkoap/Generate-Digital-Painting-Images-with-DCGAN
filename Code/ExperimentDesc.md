# DCGAN Experiment Report

In this experiment, I conducted a series of experiments to improve the image quality generated by the DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) model. I varied the image size and the number of layers in the generator and discriminator networks. The experiments were performed using a dataset of 57,838 images, and each experiment was trained for 50 epochs.
