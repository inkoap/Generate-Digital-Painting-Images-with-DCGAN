# Generate Digital Painting Images with DCGAN
Hi! This is the code I developed for my undergraduate thesis to obtain my S.Kom degree.

The purpose of my thesis was to implement the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) algorithm to generate automatic digital painting images. As we know, The demand for digital painting images continues to increase in this digital era. Due to the difficulties in acquiring knowledge and skills, as well as the time and cost involved in producing traditional art, artists face challenges. Therefore, technology is needed to automatically generate new and diverse art paintings.

The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) algorithm can assist artists in creating art more efficiently. DCGAN consists of a discriminator and a generator network. The discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated samples, while the generator tries to produce fake samples, fooling the discriminator into believing they are real.

This research conducted experiments by modifying image sizes to 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 pixels, with 4, 5, and 6 layers. This source code is the best experiment of 9 experiments conducted which is using 32x32 image size and 5 convolutional layers achieved the best performance, with the smallest generator loss value (4.8795) among the other experiments.
